**Project Overview**

Objective to help car dealership to better understand what drives the price of used vehicles using data-driven analysis.

Used Car dataset was used for this analysis - https://mo-pcco.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/BH-PCMLAI-R2/module11/practical_application_II_starter.zip

**Key features that influence car price**

I was able to derive the following based on various plots :

1. As the mileage increases, the price decreases.
2. People tend to buy cars in good condition.
3. The better the condition, higher the price of the car.
4. I donâ€™t quite agree with the data when it comes to age. I believe the price should decrease for older cars but I am not able to see that in my plot.
5. Manufacturer does matter for the sale of the car.

**Build a model to predict the price**

The Lasso model seems to predict the price the best compared to all the models I built.

**Recommendations on car inventory**

1. Cars by Japanese manufacturers seem to age well. Customers prefer these manufacturers.
2. Good/Excellent condition seems to sell better.
3. Less mileage will help sell better.
4. Car age matters for sales.
